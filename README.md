# xyzreader

This code is for Project 5 of the Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree, Make Your App Material.

The app is a mock RSS feed reader. In it's original form it is almost fully functional but lacks design aspects. The new improved app uses principles of Material Design to enhance the look and feel of the app. The main changes are:

* The app now uses the Design Support library
* The app theme extends AppCompact
* The app has an app bar and toolbar
* The app has a vibrant color scheme
* Images are stretched to cover all of the body of their containers
* A Coordinator Layout is used where appropriate
* Text and space are enhanced for better readability

The following are before-and-after snapshots of xyzreader:
